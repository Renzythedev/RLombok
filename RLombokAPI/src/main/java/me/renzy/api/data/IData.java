/**
 * Marker interface to enforce type safety for data classes such as {@link ClassData} and {@link FieldData}.
 * <p>
 * Implementing this interface indicates that a class is intended to hold specific annotation data,
 * ensuring consistency and type safety across different data types in the {@code me.renzy.annotations.data} package.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a marker interface, meaning it does not define any methods but serves to tag or mark
 * classes that are compatible with certain operations in this system.
